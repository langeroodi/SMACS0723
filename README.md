- The PSF directory contains the normalized PSF models obtained by running PSFEx on a sample of unsaturated stars in the F444W, F770W, F1000W images. 
- The SFGs directory contains the cutouts of the galaxies identified as SFGs with available MUSE spectroscopic redshifts. The MUSE spectroscopic redshift for each galaxy is provided in the specz.txt file.
